First time using Typescript(this case just pure vanilla). Just wanted to see how some functions operated and it was a nice evolution of the Mixed Message project that I'd done previously. User can get all of the adjectives, nouns, or verbs(there's far too many nouns). Added the funtion if a person wants to select 1 random word or 1 random word from adjectives, nouns and verbs. Also user can type a letter which will either get all the words that begin with said letter or will show no results found. If there's only 1 word that matches user request, that word will appear on a card with the back side saying "click to reveal" and with the word and it's definition on the other side. Same card applies if user selects 3 random words.
